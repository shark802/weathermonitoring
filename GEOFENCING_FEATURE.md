# Geo-fencing Feature Implementation

## Overview
Added 5-kilometer radius geo-fencing visualization to the admin dashboard sensor map. This feature helps administrators visualize the monitoring coverage area for each weather sensor.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Backend Changes
- **File**: `weatherapp/views.py`
- **Change**: Added `radius: 5000` (5km in meters) to the locations data structure
- **Purpose**: Provides radius information to the frontend for circle drawing

### 2. Frontend Changes
- **File**: `weatherapp/static/weatherapp/js/alert.js`
- **Changes**:
  - Added circle drawing functionality around each sensor
  - Implemented dynamic styling based on alert status
  - Added popup information for geo-fence details
  - Updated map bounds calculation to include circles

### 3. UI Enhancements
- **File**: `weatherapp/templates/admin_dashboard.html`
- **Changes**:
  - Updated map section title to include "Geo-fencing"
  - Added descriptive text explaining the feature
  - Added visual legend showing different circle types
  - Added CSS styling for geo-fence popups

## Visual Features

### Circle Styling
- **Normal State**: Blue circles with light blue fill (20% opacity)
- **Alert State**: Red circles with light red fill (20% opacity)
- **Border**: 2px weight with dashed pattern for alerts, solid for normal

### Interactive Elements
- **Click on Circle**: Zooms to sensor location
- **Click on Marker**: Zooms to sensor location (15x zoom)
- **Popup Information**: Shows sensor name, radius, and alert status

### Legend
- Blue circle: Normal monitoring zone (5km)
- Red circle: Alert zone (5km)
- Map marker: Sensor location

## Technical Details

### Data Structure
```javascript
{
    sensor_id: "sensor_id",
    name: "sensor_name",
    latitude: float,
    longitude: float,
    has_alert: boolean,
    alert_text: string,
    date_time: string,
    radius: 5000  // 5km in meters
}
```

### Map Integration
- Uses Leaflet.js for map rendering
- Circles are stored in `window.mapCircles` array for management
- Automatic cleanup on map refresh
- Responsive bounds calculation including circles

## Usage
1. Navigate to the admin dashboard
2. View the "Weather Station Locations & Geo-fencing" section
3. Observe the 5km radius circles around each sensor
4. Click on circles or markers for detailed information
5. Red circles indicate active weather alerts in that area

## Benefits
- **Visual Coverage**: Clear visualization of sensor monitoring areas
- **Alert Context**: Immediate visual indication of alert zones
- **Spatial Awareness**: Better understanding of sensor placement and coverage
- **User Experience**: Intuitive interface with clear legends and tooltips
