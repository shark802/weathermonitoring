# Enhanced SMS Alert System with Barangay Targeting

## Overview
Successfully enhanced the SMS alert system to send targeted alerts only to users in barangays affected by flood warnings based on ML predictions. This ensures users receive relevant alerts for their specific location.

## Features Implemented

### 1. User Dashboard Updates
- **Enhanced Flood Warning Display**: Updated user dashboard to show barangay-specific flood warnings
- **Real-time Updates**: AJAX integration for dynamic warning updates
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded warnings (Red/Orange/Yellow) based on risk level
- **Scrollable Interface**: Max height with overflow for multiple warnings

### 2. Targeted SMS Alert System
- **Barangay-Specific Targeting**: SMS alerts sent only to users in affected barangays
- **Smart User Retrieval**: Users matched by address field containing barangay name
- **Formatted Messages**: Customized SMS messages with barangay-specific information
- **Phone Number Formatting**: Automatic formatting for Philippine phone numbers

### 3. Enhanced ML Integration
- **Automatic SMS Triggering**: SMS alerts automatically sent when ML predicts flood risk
- **Risk-Based Messaging**: Different message content based on risk level (High/Moderate/Low)
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All 24 barangays monitored and targeted as needed

## Technical Implementation

### 1. User Dashboard Enhancements

#### Template Updates (`weatherapp/templates/user_dashboard.html`)
```html
<!-- Enhanced flood warning section -->
<div>
    <h3 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2 text-gray-700 border-b pb-1">üö® Flood Warnings by Barangay</h3>
    <div id="floodWarningContent" class="space-y-3 text-medium max-h-64 overflow-y-auto">
        {% if flood_warnings %}
            {% for warning in flood_warnings %}
                <div class="border rounded-lg p-3 {% if warning.risk_level == 'High' %}border-red-300 bg-red-50{% elif warning.risk_level == 'Moderate' %}border-orange-300 bg-orange-50{% else %}border-yellow-300 bg-yellow-50{% endif %}">
                    <!-- Warning content -->
                </div>
            {% endfor %}
        {% endif %}
    </div>
</div>
```

#### JavaScript Updates
- Dynamic flood warning updates via AJAX
- Color-coded risk level indicators
- Real-time data refresh every 10 seconds

### 2. SMS Targeting System

#### Core Functions (`weatherapp/sms_targeted_alerts.py`)

**User Retrieval by Barangay:**
```python
def get_users_by_barangay(barangay_name):
    """Get all users from a specific barangay for targeted SMS alerts."""
    cursor.execute("""
        SELECT u.user_id, u.name, u.phone_num, u.address
        FROM user u
        WHERE u.address LIKE %s AND u.phone_num IS NOT NULL AND u.phone_num != ''
    """, [f"%{barangay_name}%"])
```

**Targeted SMS Sending:**
```python
def send_targeted_sms_alerts(flood_warnings, predicted_rain_rate, predicted_duration, intensity_label):
    """Send targeted SMS alerts to users in barangays with flood warnings."""
    affected_users = get_users_by_affected_barangays(flood_warnings)
    
    for barangay, users in affected_users.items():
        # Create barangay-specific message
        sms_message = create_barangay_sms_message(...)
        
        # Send to each user in the barangay
        for user in users:
            send_single_sms(user['phone_num'], sms_message, ...)
```

**Message Creation:**
```python
def create_barangay_sms_message(barangay, warning, rain_rate, duration, intensity):
    """Create a targeted SMS message for a specific barangay."""
    message = f"üö® FLOOD ALERT - {barangay.upper()} üö®\n"
    message += f"Risk Level: {warning['risk_level']}\n"
    message += f"Predicted Rain: {rain_rate:.1f}mm over {duration:.0f}min\n"
    message += f"Intensity: {intensity}\n"
    message += f"Land Type: {warning['land_type'].replace('_', ' ').title()}\n"
    message += f"Message: {warning['message']}\n"
    message += f"Stay safe and monitor conditions!"
    return message
```

### 3. ML Integration

#### Enhanced Predictor (`weatherapp/ai/predictor.py`)
```python
# Step 5: Send Targeted SMS Alerts to Affected Barangays
try:
    from weatherapp.sms_targeted_alerts import send_targeted_sms_alerts
    
    sms_result = send_targeted_sms_alerts(
        flood_warnings, 
        predicted_rain_rate, 
        predicted_duration, 
        intensity_label
    )
    
    if sms_result["success"]:
        print(f"‚úÖ SMS Alerts: {sms_result['total_sent']} sent, {sms_result['total_failed']} failed")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"‚ùå Error sending targeted SMS alerts: {e}")
```

## SMS Message Examples

### High Risk Alert (Poblacion)
```
üö® FLOOD ALERT - POBLACION üö®
Risk Level: High
Predicted Rain: 15.0mm over 120min
Intensity: Heavy
Land Type: Low Lying
Message: High flood risk in Poblacion due to predicted Heavy rain (15.0mm) over 120 minutes. High flood risk - prone to water accumulation.
Stay safe and monitor conditions!
```

### Moderate Risk Alert (Lag-asan)
```
üö® FLOOD ALERT - LAG-ASAN üö®
Risk Level: Moderate
Predicted Rain: 5.0mm over 60min
Intensity: Moderate
Land Type: Low Lying
Message: Moderate flood risk in Lag-asan due to predicted Moderate rain. High flood risk - prone to water accumulation.
Stay safe and monitor conditions!
```
